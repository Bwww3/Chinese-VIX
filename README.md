### Iterative Methods for Linear Equations
This file includes iterative methods solving linear systems like $Ax=b$, which can be classified into two classes, fixed point methods and gradient methods.
#### 1.Fixed Point Methods
* Jacobi Method;
* Gaussian-Seidel Method;
* Successive Overrelaxation (SOR) Method.
#### 2.Gradient Methods
* Steepest Descent (SD) Method;
* Conjugate Gradient (CG) Method.
